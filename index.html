            <ol>
              <li><u>Simplicity</u>: the language must offer clear and simple concepts that facilitate its learning and application, in a way that is simple to understand and maintain.</li>
              <li><u>Naturalness</u>: this means that its application in the area for which it was designed must be done naturally, providing operators, structures and syntax for operators to work efficiently.</li>
              <li><u>Abstraction</u>: it is the ability to define and use complicated structures or operations while ignoring some details, which influences writing ability.</li>
              <li><u>Efficiency</u>: Programming languages must be translated and executed efficiently so as not to take up too much memory space or require too much time.</li>
              <li><u>Structuring</u>: the language allows programmers to write their codes according to structured programming concepts, to avoid creating errors.</li>
              <li><u>Compactness</u>: with this characteristic, it is possible to express operations concisely, without having to write too many details.</li>
              <li><u>Locality</u>: refers to the codes concentrating on the part of the program with which you are working at a given time.</li>
